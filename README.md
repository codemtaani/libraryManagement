# libraryManagement
Trying to create a simple system that will monitor the flow of books in and out of the library.
The core things to consider are:
- The existence of the book in the library. Book registration, this includes all that are entailed in the book(The name, id, description, status and maybe the chain of people who have handled it in history).
- The people who are involved in the library management(Their name, id, and the role they take, Being a reader or the library attendant).
- Make it easy to sign in and get books from the library.
